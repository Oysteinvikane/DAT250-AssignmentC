## Running the project

To build the project you can use "mvn clean install" inside the project.

Use "Java -jar target/Votesphere-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar" to run it, open localhost:8080 to see it in browser.

The frontend has been proxied from 3000 to 8080 so that the backend and frontend are on the same.
